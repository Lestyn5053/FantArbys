# FantArby's
Despite the silly name, this is a website designed for people to play my version of Fantasy FIRST Robotics, which I like to call FantArby's. It uses The Blue Alliance APIs to automate pretty much everything.

Please Note: I got the CSS from Spectre and likely will not be using this when all is said and done.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I HAVE ZERO INTENTION OF USING ARBY'S AS PART OF THE NAME FOR THIS ONCE I'M FINISHED WITH THIS SITE FOR COPYRIGHT REASONS.
